# BudgetControl
Personal Project - Android App for Budget Control

This project was created by me so I could practice my skills in Android app development. It uses database (android built-in sqlite), fragments, activities, user control, bundles, different kinds of adapters and listeners and graphs (bars and lines).

Iâ€™ve been using it for a while now and it is stable.

Next step is to get the database into the web and make it work for multiple users with a synced database.
